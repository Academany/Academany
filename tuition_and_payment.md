If a company or an institution is paying for the fees:
* Full name of the company/institution
* Full legal address of the company/institution
* VAT identification number
* Contact email to send the invoice


If you or any other person is paying the fees:
* Full name and address

Central coordination will only issue one invoice for the total amount of the program, to be paid in one instalment or splitted as described in point 1.1.

Invoices will not be issued once the program is over.

## 2.1 Cancellation of the program


Each Lab reserves the right to cancel a Program if the quota of registered students is not complete.  In the case that a Lab cancels a Program, 100% of paid tuition fees will be refunded.


## 2.2 Student’s withdrawal from the Program


A student choosing to withdraw from a program is to provide notice in writing to Central Coordination and Local Lab.
Students who drop the course and had paid part of the tuition fees, will have partial refund according to the following situations:


### 2.2.1 Nonrefundable Tuition Deposit
Tuition Deposit (1.2), also known as the admission deposit, commitment deposit, down payment or commitment fee, required to students who have been admitted to verify their intention to enroll, is non-refundable.

### 2.2.2  Withdrawal Programs prior to the official beginning of class period
If the student paid part or the totality of the Program’s tuition fees prior to the class period, and communicates the withdrawal, Central Coordination will reimburse the 85% of the fees paid that exceeds the Tuition Deposit (1.2), and reserves the 15% in concept of administrative costs.


IMPORTANT: to be subject to refund, the student must give proper justification of the reason for withdrawal.


### 2.2.3 Withdrawal Programs after official beginning of class period
 There is no refund of any kind after the official beginning of classes.




## 2.3      Ceasing attendance without notification
If a student fails to deliver the assignments requested by the instructors, misses the evaluation periods, does not cover 90% of classes and/or fails to attend more than 15 consecutive classes, Central Coordination understands that the student abandoned the program. In this situation, the student loses all the accomplished credits and any right to claim for refund. In addition, Central Coordination will not deliver the student’s diploma nor any kind of certificate requested.
